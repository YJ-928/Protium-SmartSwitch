# Protium-SmartSwitch
## My B.E 6th Sem Mini Project, A Smart-Switch that ,"Converts a Simple Home To A Smart Home".
## Special Thanks to 'Vaibhav S. ALur', "https://github.com/vb47".
### A brief summary:
The era of neverending growth of the internet and its application, smart home system or home automation system is highly increasing to provide comfort in life and improving the quality of life. The main objective of this smart home system is to make human life easy and comfortable by using IOT. Now a day as people are so busy with their work pressure so the will be looking for a smarter life style. Home automation or domotics is building automation for a home, called a smart home or smart house. A home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as
access control and alarm systems. A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central hub.
### Key objectives:
The key objectives of this work were to research, design, implement and evaluate a Smart Switch Control System (SSCS) using Wi-Fi technology, and evaluate the system in terms of its accuracy and time to control switches.
To achieve this, the following key components were delivered.
1. An Android mobile application was developed to control an Arduino UNO board.
2. A Wi-Fi module which facilitated the connection and communication between the mobile
application and the actual device.
3. A programmable board/microcontroller which acted as the brain of the system and executed
key functions.
4. An internal security system which protected the device from unauthorized users.
